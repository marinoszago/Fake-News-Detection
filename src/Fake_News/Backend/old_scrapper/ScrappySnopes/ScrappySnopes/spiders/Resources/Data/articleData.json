In most cases, the pages sharing this content would have received a share of the advertising revenue generated by the ads embedded in those articles.", "Providr\u2019s business model of producing viral content for high-follower pages to share in exchange for a portion of ad revenues was far from unique. Years earlier, an entire economy had developed around the concept of enlisting pages with many followers to share articles and split ad profits. However, on 25 January 2018, Facebook ", " they would be changing their ", " regarding branded content effective 28 February 2018, stipulating that Facebook page owners could no longer \u201caccept anything of value to post content that you did not create or were not involved in the creation of, or that does not feature you.\u201d", "Although this policy change had no discernible impact on most Facebook users, several social media companies had built an industry around recruiting popular Facebook pages to share viral content in return for ad revenue splits, a practice now banned under current Facebook policy. Many of those social media companies, including the prominent firm ", ", announced that they would be suspending operations because their business models were not sustainable under Facebook\u2019s new rules.", "Providr CEO Gary Lipovetsky, however, ", " in a since-deleted post that he had a solution which would make his company\u2019s business model compliant with Facebook. Lipovetsky\u2019s solution was the inclusion of custom software that appended the name of the Facebook page or celebrity sharing Providr\u2019s story below that of the actual author, giving each article the appearance that it had been co-authored by, or \u201cfeatured,\u201d each person sharing the post. Lipovetsky repeatedly assured his clients that Providr remained compliant with Facebook\u2019s rules.", "We first reported on Providr\u2019s sleight-of-hand in a 26 May 2018 ", ", and as part that reporting we emailed Facebook a request for comment on Providr\u2019s deceptive use of code to generate co-authorship bylines. At the time, a Facebook spokesperson told us that such a practice would, in theory, be contrary to their policies, and that pages violating such policies could expect to see their distribution and monetization \u201csignificantly\u201d reduced (or even be shut down).", "On the same day that we contacted Facebook, email and analytics records we later obtained from multiple individuals who had worked with Providr showed that Facebook had likely revoked Providr\u2019s inclusion in their \u201c", "\u201d program, slashing the reach of Providr\u2019s content dramatically.", "Instant Articles is a feature Facebook offers to publishers that allows their content to be distributed natively within the Facebook app. This process, Facebook avers, can expand the reach of pages shared. It also allows Facebook themselves to place ads in those articles, providing them with a cut of the profits generated by the articles as well.", "To make matters even worse for Providr, on 29 May 2018 Facebook again ", " their branded content rules in a way that would be crushing to Providr\u2019s business: They began to crack down on \u201cmanufactured sharing,\u201d or the \u201cinauthentic\u201d sharing of the same articles on multiple unrelated pages.", "In an unsolicited email following our original report, one anonymous individual claiming an association with Providr described \u201cthe shit show that\u2019s taking place\u201d thanks to the loss of these publishing privileges. Ever since our May reporting, Providr has allegedly withheld money it owes their publishing partners. (Providr CEO Gary Lipovetsky declined to comment on a detailed list of questions we sent him, citing ongoing discussions with Facebook. Facebook likewise declined to respond to a detailed list of questions, or offer comment on anything regarding Providr\u2019s status as a publisher for this story.)", "Several events began to unfold when Facebook allegedly revoked Providr\u2019s Instant Articles access on the day we inquired about Providr\u2019s practices. First, publishers who were sharing those Providr links saw a dramatic decrease in the amount of money they were earning from the Providr posts they shared on their pages. A publisher who uses the pseudonym Clea and operates the Facebook page \u201c", "\u201d saw the reach (and revenue) from Providr\u2019s posts decrease dramatically, as reported in her Providr dashboard. The explanation she was given by Florind Metalla, the manager of publisher relations for Providr, was that the company had \u201cnoticed a glitch with Instant Articles and [were] looking into it with our team at Facebook.\u201d", "On 22 June 2018, Clea received an email from a Providr publisher relations executive named Paul Williams that did not begin reassuringly: \u201cI wanted to notify you that Providr is still operational and that they will make an announcement soon to update you all. In terms of May payment, it will be made at the end of [June].\u201d", "That payment never arrived, according to Clea. A separate Facebook publisher partnered with Providr, who wished to remain anonymous, reached out to tell us that, like Clea, they did not receive their Providr revenue payment. In early July, that publisher emailed the accounting department at Providr and received the following automated response (which suggested many other publishers had also made similar inquiries about missing revenues) blaming Facebook for Providr\u2019s inability to make payments:", "Another former Providr publishing partner, a man in Pakistan who runs several high-traffic Facebook pages and wished to remain anonymous for fear that Facebook would punish his pages, told us via Skype that he received the same canned response when he asked about his payment. His frustration was palpable:", "After Clea\u2019s payment failed to arrive by 30 June, she received a message sent on 2 July 2018 from Prashast Singh, Providr\u2019s manager of operations, which described the ad revenue situation in a bit more detail:", "The third consequence of Facebook\u2019s actions against Providr \u2014 for some the most damaging aspect \u2014 was that pages such as Clea\u2019s, which she had spent years building up independent of her association with Providr, were either suspended, shut down, or blocked from sharing any links whatsoever on Facebook.", "Though she was never told so explicitly by Facebook, Clea suspects that the few Providr articles she had shared caused her page to be banned permanently from sharing links. Several other publishers who also shared Providr content were placed on temporary bans, so it remains unclear why Clea\u2019s page might have faced a permanent ban on link-sharing.", "These events, Clea maintained to us in an email, meant that her brief, eight-week association with Providr effectively destroyed a ", " she had been building since 2010 that had evolved to become her sole source of income:", "(We have not independently assessed Clea\u2019s page for Facebook compliance, and Facebook declined our multiple requests to comment on the status of her page, citing privacy concerns.)", "One could advance the logical argument that the arrangement Clea had with Providr, in which she would receive payment through her Facebook page from a third party in exchange for posting the third party\u2019s content outside the context of Facebook\u2019s branded content system, was a clear violation of existing policy at the time. This argument would suggest that action against her page was justified, regardless of Providr\u2019s involvement in the matter.", "Based upon correspondence and internal company documents provided to us by several former publishers, however, one could also make a compelling argument that Providr aggressively recruited people using false claims of Facebook compliance. In this scenario, Providr was ultimately responsible for the destruction of Facebook pages that had made a good-faith effort to follow Facebook\u2019s rules. \u201c[I] fully believed I was in compliance with Facebook right up until I got the link ban.\u201d Clea wrote, \u201cI am completely devastated.\u201d", "Providr\u2019s efforts to recruit high-follower pages was aggressive and full of what turned out to be unfounded confidence. In his opening pitch to prospective Facebook page owners, according to emails obtained by Snopes, Providr operations manager Paul Williams included an infographic in his emails claiming the company\u2019s approach was \u201c100% Facebook compliant and verified through [our] direct relationship with Facebook.\u201d", "As recently as 12 July 2018, Providr\u2019s corporate page still ", " that \u201cFacebook likes our content [because] we have a close working relationship with Facebook [that] enables us to help our celebrity and social media influencer partners develop their accounts, grow their audiences, and increase their reach on Facebook.\u201d", "Williams first reached out to Clea in October 2016. She told him she wasn\u2019t interested in working with Providr because she was under the impression that without a verified check mark on her page, she would not be able to collect income under Facebook\u2019s rules. She ignored multiple follow-ups from Williams before she finally responded to a March 2017 email. In his response to her concerns, Williams wrote:", "In total, Williams contacted Clea at least 20 times between October 2016 and August 2017 without successfully convincing her to partner with Providr. Then Florind Metalla, the manager of publisher relations at Providr, initiated the recruitment process all over again.", "On 30 January 2018, Clea received another unsolicited email, this time from Metalla. \u201cI\u2019m contacting you with an opportunity regarding your Facebook Page \u2026 working with Providr to earn a passive income,\u201d he wrote. The email ended with an offer: \u201cI\u2019d like to create an account for you so that you can start testing our content,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no long-term contracts and you can terminate with us at any time.\u201d", "Clea did not respond to this email, either. Between January and February 2018, Metalla emailed Clea eight times with canned follow-up pitches. By the end of February 2018, however, Facebook\u2019s new branded content rules were about to be instituted, and Clea used the introduction of these new rules as an opportunity to turn down Providr politely:", "Metalla was not swayed by Clea\u2019s accurate characterization of the Facebook publishing market and convinced her to talk things over via telephone. In a follow-up email on 8 March 2018, Metalla sold Clea on Providr\u2019s use of fabricated bylines (the dodge that informed our original ", " on Providr), asserting that it was an acceptable way around Facebook\u2019s rules:", "\u201cUnfortunately, Florind was very persuasive,\u201d Clea wrote to us in an email describing her decision to finally partner with Providr. (Metalla did not respond to our request for comment on this story.)", "Now, Providr allegedly owes Clea money, and she has lost the ability to post links on her Facebook page with over three million followers, which she tells us has been the primary source of income for her and her family. While some people allegedly punished for posting Providr content have had their privileges restored, Clea has not, and Facebook has told her their decision is final and unappealable.", "On 21 June 2018, after Clea made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Metalla to discuss the money she was owed and the status of her now largely inoperable Facebook page, Metalla informed Clea that he was leaving Provdr effective the next day. Clea stated that Metalla told her \u201cHe was starting with a new media company for a \u2018fresh start.\u2019\u201d", "The company that Metalla had joined for that \u201cfresh start\u201d was a company based out of the same Toronto office space that Metalla\u2019s email signature indicated belonged to Providr. That company, ", ", was co-founded by the same two people who started Providr: Gary Lipovetsky and Michael Tulman.", "These two individuals, along with Paul Williams (the person currently in charge of publisher relations at whatever is left of Providr) have been in business together since at least 2009, when they started a company called \u201cDealFind.com\u201d which they subsequently sold in 2012.", "Florind Metalla\u2019s ", " at Social Pulse Marketing, an apparent promotion, is \u201cDirector of Strategic Partnerships,\u201d according to their website: \u201cHe works closely with our partners to ensure that the right strategies are in place and the right teams are involved to ensure smooth and flawless execution.\u201d", "While Social Pulse Marketing has, according to Gary Lipovetsky\u2019s LinkedIn ", ", been in existence since 2016 and first established a web presence in ", ", the influx of former Providr executives to it appears to be a more recent phenomenon.

Every page owner we spoke with expressed that same concern: that Lipovetsky and his associates might be attempting to get out of their debt to publishers by shifting resources to Social Pulse Marketing before declaring bankruptcy at Providr, though we cannot confirm this assertion.", "On 16 June 2018, just two weeks before Providr would miss its deadline for paying out May revenues to publishers, a picture posted to his private Instagram account showed the Ontario-based Lipovetsky \u201cdiscovering the Hamptons\u201d with his wife:", "On 5 July, a new character with the title of \u201cDirector of Public Relations\u201d for Providr responded to one of Clea\u2019s repeated requests that she be paid what she is owed.
